# Recommendation System on Kuierc Dataset

This project implements a recommendation system using the **Kuierc dataset**. The goal is to predict user preferences and suggest relevant items based on historical interaction data. The system utilizes collaborative filtering and content-based techniques to generate personalized recommendations. By exploring and analyzing user-item interactions, this project aims to demonstrate how recommendation algorithms can be applied to real-world scenarios such as personalized content delivery or product suggestions.

## Data analysis

In the [data_analysis/](data_analysis/) directory, you'll find a notebook that demonstrates various visualizations of the database. I used this notebook to explore and better understand the data, as well as to experiment with its values.

## Models

This project is a comprehensive implementation of several recommender systems
explored in class. The code is organized in Python notebooks that can be found
in the [models/](models/) directory. The goal of this project is to demonstrate different
approaches to building recommendation models, including a **Hybrid Model**, a
**Two-Towers Neural Network**, and an **ALS (Alternating Least Squares)** model.
